# GIT-FLOW DESCRIPTION  (git version 2.10)

## TL;DR Full git-flow example in one snippet

This snippet requires `git config --global push.default simple` and `git config --global --bool pull.rebase true`

    git checkout develop
    git pull
    git checkout -b "IDEMIA2019-XXXX OPTIONAL_MESSAGE"
    ---here commit your all changes

    ---and after commits
    ----squashing
    git rebase -i HEAD~COMMITS_NUMBER
    git push -f

    ----rebasing
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout IDEMIA2019-XXXX
    git rebase master
    git push -f

    ---and if PR is approved and you want to merge from command-line
    git checkout master
    git merge --ff-only IDEMIA2019-XXXX
    git push

    ---remove branch after merge
    ----remote
    git push -d IDEMIA2019-XXX

    ----locally
    git branch -d IDEMIA2019-XXX

## Full description

Guide for managing branches and making sure that our current `master` branch is not polluted with unnecessary commits and at every point in time (every commit) it can be built and all tests are passing.

To simplify, further in this guide main development branch is called `master`, but in reality it can be 'service-manager' or 'kansas-wyoming-4'.

## Before you start working
Set git's push.default to simple:

    git config --global push.default simple

This will prevent unfortunate accidents when using git push --force. It's also preferable that you set:

    git config --global --bool pull.rebase true

So that typing `git pull` will be equivalent to `git pull --rebase`.


## Start working on feature
When you start working on any task that you should create a new branch for this purpose. Naturally, this branch should be created from `master` branch. You can do this from command line: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` when being on `master` branch.
Important is the name of the branch: it should start with **JIRA** issue number i.e. `IDEMIA2019-1234`. After this you can add short description if you want.

## Finish working on feature
After you're done with the feature, you should first synchronize your branch with `master` branch (actually you should do it regularly) with rebase, which applies your changes on top of another branch:

    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout IDEMIA2019-XXX
    git rebase master
    git push -f

Then create **Pull Request** on bitbucket and introduce changes suggested by reviewers.

After required number of reviewers approves pull request, you should review your branch to see if there are any commits you would want to squash.
Generally we prefer do have more commits than less. This way more information is retained in git history, and later it's easier for other developers to see what the code changes stem from.

For sure you should squash all commits which fix code smells and other small changes non related with feature.
If you have to push commits related with other feature, maybe they should be added in other branch. Big pull requests are not best idea:)

The best way to squash commit is to use "interactive rebase" which you start from command line:

    git rebase --interactive COMMIT_HASH

or shorter

    git rebase -i COMMIT_HASH

where COMMIT_HASH indicates commit from which you want to rebase, so to simplify: first commit in your branch.

You can also use number of commits. This command for example will squash last 3 commits:

    git rebase -i HEAD~3

Nice tutorial for squashing commits: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history

After squashing remember to push your changes, --force parameter is required because you've changed the pointer to parent commit:

    git push -f

Finally, synchronized your branch with `master` branch and you're sure all tests are passing (or, at least, there is no regression), you can merge your branch with `master`.
You can do this from bitbucket by clicking `merge` button. You can do this also from commandline, but if pushing on `master` branch is forbidden, you can only use bitbucket.
Merging from command-line example:


    git checkout master
    git pull
    git merge --ff-only IDEMIA2019-XXXX
    git push


## Puling from remote
Sometimes when you try push to the remote repository your changes are rejected because there were some remote changes. In such case do not do a simple git pull - this will create a merge commit. Do a pull with rebase instead:

    git pull -r


## Feature with subtasks
Often features are so big, that they should be divided into subtasks and there are a few persons working on it. In that case each subtask should be seperate branch, created from feature branch and also named from its (subtask's) JIRA issue number.

Example:

We have a feature `IDEMIA2019-1234` with subtasks: `IDEMIA2019-1235` and `IDEMIA2019-1236`.

First we want to create branch from `master` branch for `IDEMIA2019-1234`


                      D      IDEMIA2019-1234
                     /
    A --- B --- C        master

Then, when one starts working on, branch `IDEMIA2019-1235` should be created from `IDEMIA2019-1234` branch.

                         E   IDEMIA2019-1235
                        /
                      D      IDEMIA2019-1234
                     /
    A --- B --- C        master

Analogically branch `IDEMIA2019-1236` should be created.
After work on subtasks is finished, first synchronize your subtask branch with feature branch - use rebase for clear history, so:

    git checkout IDEMIA2019-1234
    git pull
    git checkout IDEMIA2019-1235
    git rebase IDEMIA2019-1234

Then merge your subtask branch to feature branch:

    git checkout IDEMIA2019-1234
    git merge IDEMIA2019-1235

## Squashing
TODO add here squashing example


# Summary
When working on feature `IDEMIA2019-XXXX`, create branch named `IDEMIA2019-XXXX`
When you finished working on that feature make sure that:
- You synchronized your branch with `master` (rebase)
- You ran some critical test suite and - possibly - all tests on CI and there is no regression
- Pull Request (if exists) is approved
- You sqashed all commits
- Merge your feature branch to `master` - it should create one commit

# Other useful git commands

    ---remove branch locally
    git branch -d IDEMIA2019-XXX

    ---remove branch from remote
    git push -d IDEMIA2019-XXX  (in older git versions: git push origin --delete IDEMIA2019-XXX)

    --- change last commit message
    git commit --amend -m "IDEMIA2019-XXX NEW_MESSAGE"

    --- cherry-pick one commit
    git cherry-pick COMMIT_HASH

    --- cherry-pick range of commits INCLUSIVE
    git cherry-pick FIRST_COMMIT_HASH^..LAST_COMMIT_HASH
